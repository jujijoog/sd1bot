# SD1 MEMORIAL DISCORD QUOTE BOT

This is a discord bot that uses a json file as input, grabs a random json object from this file
and posts it in a given discord channel when any chatter triggers the bot with a text command.
The json file included is a complete scrape of all messages sent in Acoustic Mafia server over the 
course of about a year from a friend and fellow discord user, who passed away recently. When triggered the bot will display a random message sent by SD1. 

Triggers/Commands


1. !sd -- Displays random sd1 message from acoustic mafia server scraped logs. 
2. !search "Term-Goes-Here" -- Searches for keyword(s) and provides 4 timestamped results per request.

Example:

and the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their proper dwellingâ€”these he has kept in darkness, bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great day....off local bitcoins
